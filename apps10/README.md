# APPS10: Options for Building and Running Your App in the Cloud  

[![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-APPS-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-apps)

## Session Abstract

We’ll show you how Tailwind Traders avoided a single point of failure, using cloud services to deploy their company website to multiple regions. We’ll cover all the options they considered, explain how and why they made their decisions, then dive into the components of their implementation.  

In this session, you’ll see how they used Microsoft technologies like VS Code, Azure Portal, and Azure CLI to build a secure application that runs and scales on Linux and Windows VMs and Azure Web Apps, with a companion phone App.
